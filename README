DSC 200 â€“ Data Wrangling
Lab 8: Accessing Data Via API

Goals:
    - Identify API assessable data sources
    - Write Python scripts to access data via API

Instructions:
Several organizations make their datasets public. Some of these datasets can easily be accessed
via a publicly available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). For this lab, you are required
to identify at least 2 different sources from which data can be accessed via API. Ensure that
there as at least 1 source that does not require authentication and another that does. The
following is good reference for public APIs: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis.

Write a Python function for each selected data sources. Each function should connect to and
extract data via the published API and create a CSV file for the dataset. You may choose to use
the csv module or the pandas library for this purpose. Your program should provide a menu
from which the user can select which dataset they would want to access. Remember to include
pagination.


Rubric:

At least two data sources selected 10 points
A function implemented for all data sources 20 points
Menu implemented correctly 8 points
Code appropriately commented 2 points
Total 40 points

What to submit:
Submit a single python script containing your solution. Ensure that each function contains the
documentation about the data source, the API being used, the login credentials, and all relevant
information needed to test the code.
